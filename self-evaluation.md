How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel pretty good about arrays so far. I see how they can be helpful to use in simple tasks. I would like to learn more about how they are used in real world examples amd more complex tasks we might see. 

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I just need to continually practice to enhance my muscle memory and become more efficient. 

What questions do you have about Arrays?

I know this is very basic knowledge of arrays, but what is next? How might we see arrays used in the real world/our first job? How complex can they get?
